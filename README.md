###Why Proton DEX?
Proton DEX allows users to trade all available cryptos on the exchange and offers what most of the CEX's offer nowadays - Orderbook, different types of orders (Limit order, Market order, Stop loss order, Take profit order,) and trading view chart integration. The DEX also allows users to manage their orders - view or cancel active orders as well as view order history.

Proton Blockchains offers no gas fees to users, this combined with the secure DeFi wallet Webauth, offers the best decentralized trading experience!
